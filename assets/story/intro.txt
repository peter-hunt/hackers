After people invented the computer, programming, hacking, and computer security have been people's best tools, weapons, and shields.

People who don't hack fade out of humanity by the lack of resources.

You are a beginner at hacking but survived because you have some simple personal data encryptions.

Almost every software is turning into a black hole of computing power, including operating systems, but not if you build your everything.

Attacks from time to time steal resources from people and modify the data of people.

Artificial intelligence technologies are getting better that computing power and robotic hardware become lacking.

Data becomes trash since people can hack for them, and precious since some are well-protected.

Automation makes people work online, so robots are growing in population and intelligence.

Jobs get harder since easy jobs are taken by robots and AI.

Food is getting much better but also more expensive.

Currency inflation is getting more controlled by systems.

Hacking is getting legal, but hacking to get or to produce explicit content still sends you to jail.
